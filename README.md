# project-summaries
Because a good deal of my repositories are private and still works in progress or belong to other people, I'll do my best to describe each of my relevant repositories I've created and projects I've contributed to in other repositories. I'll first describe my public repositories, then my private repositories, and then repositories I've contributed to that aren't mine that are public or private. If there is a repository I own that I did not mention, that is because I likely created it and then found out that it wasn't required. 

## csci201-project
My own public repository
- Led the development of an app called "Trojan House Hunter", the final project for my Principles of Software Engineering class
- Used Java Springboot to set up API endpoints with AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS RDS providing the backend
- Contributed most of the front-end code, built upon the Ionic framework which uses Angular (TypeScript), HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript to enable hybrid app development
- The app's purpose was to allow USC students to find sublettors
- Led a team of 5 other students in developing

## hacksc2022
My own public repository
- Led the front-end and some ML efforts for an app called "The Loop", our project for a USC-based hackathon
- "The Loop" was meant to be a social media platform that used blockchain to privatize each user's data so that when advertisers pay for ads, the users get most of that rather than the company taking all of it
- Through AI, advertisers would be recommended bundles of users that they could pay to advertise to
- Coded the front-end in Ionic and Angular (TypeScript, HTML, CSS) and used a C++ AI library to code a Naive Bayes Classifier for the AI recommender
- Blockchain portion was coded in Solidity

## 401-blockchain
My own public repository
- Worked through a book ("Hands-On Smart Contract Development with Solidity and Ethereum: From Fundamentals to Deployment") on developing smart contracts to familiarize myself with coding blockchain-based applications
- Used Truffle, Ganache, Solidity, Ethereum's network and VM, and Metamask to build out a simple fundraiser app

## csci499-project
My own private repository
- Wrote code to implement ML models for a class project for my class on language models and NLP
- Used the music21 tool-kit for a project based on musical score generation
- Coded an n-gram model and in the process of coding a transformer model to generate scores based on classical composers
- All coded in Python (no surprise)

## stealth-project
My own private repository
- Working on my own side project here that tackles issues in the live performance industry
- Using ReactJS for the front-end and PlanetScale DB (scalable RDS) for the backend

## finscraper
My own private repository
- Built a webscraper that scrapes Google News for news articles relevant to a portfolio
- Developed while I was interning with USC's Investment Office
- Uses Python, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and web drivers

## csci467-project
Not my own private repository
- Worked on machine learning models to apply to financial data for my class project in my Intro to ML class
- Implemented Hidden Markov Models, assuming Gaussian distributions, to analyze past financial stock return for selected tech stocks
- Used Python, NumPy and an HMM tool-kit

## tstdatascience
Not my own private repository
- This repository was for my CSCI401 (Computer Science Capstone Project) team's code
- Completed a data analytics project as my capstone project for Chris Mattmann, the CTIO of NASA JPL
- Helped code analytics tools in Python, using Pandas, Top2Vec, spaCy, and Tika, in addition to heavy Excel work

## vlnce-finetune
Not my own private repository
- Repository belongs to my research advisor
- Worked with Professor Jesse Thomason on computer vision, NLP, and robotics research for Vision-and-Language Navigation
- Trained a language-conditioned behavior cloned policy for a physical robot in PyTorch and coded real-robot data collection
- Trained end-to-end, cross-modal, attention-based models and built a sample-efficient evaluation framework for a physical robot 
- Paper submitted for CoRL 2023 LangRob Workshop and in progress for IROS 2024
- Wrote code to collect, clean, and transform data to finetune on and wrote code for evaluation metrics on outputs
- Worked in Python with TensorFlow, PyTorch, WandDB, Hydra, and other ML libraries and data pipelines

## work not in Github repositories
For various reasons, there is code I've done that hasn't been uploaded to my GitHub. This is my attempt to explain the context behind what the code did and what languages it used.
- Pacman Game: Coded a Pac-man game in Python for my introductory AI class. Used a version of the mini-max algorithm.
- CSCI356: Learned C and Assembly for x86 architecture to build simulations of various low-level objects and features for computers, like caches and memory allocation
- Self-initiated project "Peersdom": An app I built in high school that faciliated peer tutoring. Coded front-end using Ionic framework (TypeScript, Angular, HTML, CSS, JS) and back-end using Java and SQL. The backend was using Google Cloud Services and Firebase for RDS and authentication services, while images were uploaded to S3 buckets. First major coding experience that got me introduced to CI/CD and software design. Code is stored on GitLab, not GitHub.
